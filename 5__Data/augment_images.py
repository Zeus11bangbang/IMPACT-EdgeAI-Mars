Image Augmentation Script for Deep Learning Dataset Preparation

Description:
This script is tailored for augmenting a specific class of images within a deep learning dataset. It selectively processes images based on their 
class label, which is indicated at the end of each image's filename. The script applies a series of transformations to create augmented variations, 
thereby enhancing the diversity of the dataset and potentially improving the generalization capability of a deep learning model trained on this data.

The transformations applied include:
- Random horizontal and vertical flips to mimic alternative orientations.
- Random rotations to represent tilted angles.
- Color jittering to simulate variations in lighting and camera quality.
- Random affine transformations to introduce changes in perspective.
- Random cropping to the target size to represent different scales and focal points.
- Occasional conversion to grayscale to account for the absence of color.

The script processes images with a fixed size of 227x227 pixels, a standard dimension for many convolutional neural networks.

Configuration:
Before running the script, configure the following variables:
- `IMAGE_DIR`: Path to the directory containing the original images.
- `TRAIN_SET_FILE`: Filename of the text file listing all images with their labels.
- `SPECIFIED_LABEL`: The label identifier for the class of images to augment.
- `NUM_AUGMENTED_IMAGES`: The number of augmented images to generate per original image.

Behavior:
The script reads through the list of image filenames from `TRAIN_SET_FILE`, filtering for those ending with the `SPECIFIED_LABEL`. For each filtered image, 
it applies the augmentation transformations and saves the new images in the same directory as the originals. Augmented images are named using a prefix 'aug_' 
followed by an index and the original filename.

Naming Convention:
The script assumes that image filenames conclude with an underscore followed by their class label, e.g., '1996MH0006030020800245C00_DRCL.jpg 4', 
where '4' is the class label. The script extracts this label from each line in the training set file to match against `SPECIFIED_LABEL`.

Usage:
Directly run the script after setting the necessary configuration variables. No command-line arguments are required.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (PIL fork)
- torchvision library

Ensure that all dependencies are installed and that the Python environment is set up correctly before executing this script.
